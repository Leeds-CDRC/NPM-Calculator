# The NPM calculator and underlying nutrientprofiler R package provide functions to help assess product information against the UK Nutrient Profiling Model (2004/5) and scope for HFSS legislation around product placement. It is designed to provide low level functions that implement UK Nutrient Profiling Model scoring that can be applied across product datasets.
